Stats 204 - Final Project code (Rmd and R file have the same code) and data set

We analyze a data set of Manhattan Real Estate that includes property price in USD. We are interested in determining which models are the most effective at predicting real estate price, as well as which variables are significant predictors. In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we introduce the most important variables in our data set and provide several insightful visualizations. We also justify a log-transformation to our response variable. In The Data section, we walk readers through the data cleaning process, which includes re-factoring categorical variables and performing Principal Component Analysis on several highly correlated variables. In the Modeling section, we introduce the Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression and XGBoost models that we fit. The final model resulted in 10 significant variables for the prediction of property value in Manhattan. In the Conclusions section, the reader will find a summary table with the final models' training set fit metric as well as the out-of sample test set performance. Here, one may find residual plots from the final model as well as shortcomings and potential further work for this data.
